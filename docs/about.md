The spjall documentation documents how to build and run spjall.
In addition, it functions as a runbook for running spjall for debugging.

In later stages we would like to explain other aspects of spjall:
 - how to update spjall, where is the server (obv no password)
 - where data is saved (s3) and how to configure it
 - the basic structure of the application, how frontend and backend talk via web sockets, and client to client via rtcConnection
 - the apache magic that makes spjall work
